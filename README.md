Coursework from MATH-GA-2757 Regulation and Regulatory Risk Models <br>
In the project, we initially apply Gussian and Quasi-Gaussian Models to setup credit curve and calculate PV of expected exposure(PVEE)
for the swap contract. Then following Cox Default Processes we price unilateral and bilateral CVA/DVA/net CVA for the swap contract. 
The last part is the implementation of regulatory capital calculation by IMM credit risk models. For more detail please review the attached 
jupyter file.
